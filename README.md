### About me 
I'm currently an aspiring Software Engineer with a passion for gaming. My favorite video game at the moment is Stalker: Shadow of Chernobyl, and I'm completely engrossed in it, still trying to conquer every challenge it throws my way. I'm so inspired by it that I've started working on a Stalker mod. While I don't have a concrete concept for it just yet, I'm excited about the creative process and the possibility of crafting something truly engaging. Ultimately, my dream is to become a game developer, and this project is a step toward realizing that goal.
