### About me 
I'm a 14-year-old aspiring Software Engineer with a deep passion for gaming. Currently, my favorite video game is Stalker: Shadow of Chernobyl, and I'm fully immersed in its challenges, constantly striving to overcome them. This game has inspired me so much that I've begun developing a Stalker mod. Although I'm still refining the concept, I'm thrilled about the creative journey and the potential to create something truly captivating. My ultimate dream is to become a game developer, and this project marks a significant step towards achieving that goal.

Additionally, I am learning C++. I know how to handle input and work with string variables, but I am still struggling with some aspects. However, I am determined and will never give up. also planing to join Imesense Which is a programmer group and make the ixray-engine which is Stable repository of the modernized X-Ray 1.6 game engine and it the reason why i learning c++ which i buff up my experance in programming
